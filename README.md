In the process of creating this application were used JS functions and methods that help in working with strings, numbers, objects and arrays.

Generate a password when the button is clicked.
When user clicks the button our app presents a series of prompts for password criteria:

1. Length of password (at least 8 characters but no more than 128);

2. Character types (Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&\*, etc.));

Then code validate for each input and at least one character type is selected.

After all prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
